# RenderCV App

We are developing an app on top of our open-source engine ([`rendercv` Python package](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv)). The [web app](https://app.rendercv.com) is now available in beta, with iOS and Android versions coming soon.

## Mission

Writing a CV is hard. Formatting a CV is even harder.

How do we build our CVs and resumes today? We open up Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Overleaf, or an online resume builder. Then we export it to PDF, upload it to cloud storage, and hope we can find it later.

But what really happens over time?

-   **Lost versions:** We often end up digging through old emails and folders, trying to locate the right, latest version.
-   **Lost history:** It's nearly impossible to revisit the resume you used 15 years ago or see how your career narrative has evolved.
-   **Formatting headaches:** Most feedback you receive on your resume is about formatting—and you're stuck wrestling with layouts, fonts, and spacing.
-   **No mobile editing:** Spot a typo at the last second? Good luck fixing it from your phone.

These frustrations point to a fundamental problem: there's no dedicated application designed from the ground up to handle CVs and resumes.

We've solved similar problems in other domains by building purpose-built apps:

-   **Photos:** We no longer manage photos in messy folders. Apps now organize, categorize, and let us search through them effortlessly.
-   **Notes:** Tools like Notion and Obsidian replaced endless Word documents, giving us a powerful interface to create, structure, and access notes.
-   **Music:** We no longer store MP3 files in hard disks. Now, we have Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music. They let us find and enjoy music effortlessly without worrying about MP3s.

All of these examples share a common idea: they are purpose-built apps designed specifically for their applications. Yet, we don't have a purpose-built CV/resume app that embodies this same idea.

Imagine a dedicated CV/resume app:

-   **Content-first:** You just write your content and instantly get a polished, professional PDF. No fighting with formatting.
-   **One secure home:** Your CV versions are neatly organized and secured in one place. No more version chaos.
-   **Available on mobile:** Access and edit your CV from anywhere, fix typos on the go, and share instantly with a single tap.
-   **Full customization:** Prefer a certain format? Bring your own Typst templates into the app.
-   **Marketplace of themes:** Share your own themes or explore those created by others!
-   **Open-source core:** Built on an open-source engine, ensuring your documents are always reproducible and never trapped in a proprietary system.

Introducing RenderCV, an initiative by a passionate team dedicated to bringing this vision to life.  Our web app is already available in beta, and iOS and Android versions are on the way. At its heart is our open-source rendering engine, ensuring reliability and reproducibility.
