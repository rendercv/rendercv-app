# RenderCV App

We are developing an app on top of our open-source engine ([`rendercv` Python package](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv)). The [web app](https://app.rendercv.com) is now available in beta, with iOS and Android versions coming soon.

## Mission

There isn't currently a cross-platform tool that allows people to store and maintain their CVs.

Therefore, people generally:

-   Create their CVs using Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Overleaf.
-   Save them as PDFs in their cloud storage.
-   Access the PDFs from their PCs or mobile phones whenever they need them.

But:

-   Are we truly organized with our cloud storage, or do we end up searching through old emails to find our CVs?
-   Can we effectively version-control our CVs? Can we find versions from, say, 2012?
-   Is the formatting of our CVs good, or do we often receive feedback about bad formatting?
-   If we spot a typo at the last minute, can we quickly fix it from our mobile devices?

We have solved these kinds of problems in other areas with apps before:

-   **Photos:** We no longer need to worry about folders and files; photo apps organize them for us, doing a much better job because they're tailored for it.
-   **Notes:** We don't need to keep track of lots of Word files anymore; we have tools like Notion and Obsidian.
-   **Music:** We used to store music as MP3 files in our folders. Now, we have Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music.

All of these examples share a common idea: they are purpose-built apps designed specifically for their applications. Yet, we don’t have a purpose-built CV app that embodies this same idea.

Imagine an app for CVs:

-   You simply write your content and get a very professional CV as a PDF.
-   You store your CVs and lock their versions where everything is securely stored.
-   You can access them from your mobile device and share any version of your CV with a click.
-   You can fix typos directly from your mobile app.
-   You even have the option to bring your own LaTeX templates to the app.
-   There is a platform where people can share their templates, allowing you to choose the best one for your purpose.

We are building this app on top of our open-source engine so that your CVs generated with RenderCV will always be reproducible, and you can use RenderCV without using the app.

##  Comments and Feedback

We aim to complete this app for all platforms as quickly as possible, and we'd love to hear your feedback and comments as we move forward. Your input is highly valued.
